### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

#### 1. Backend (Spring Boot)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dairymitra.git # Replace YOUR_USERNAME
    cd dairymitra/backend
    ```
2.  **Configure PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL server is running.
    *   Create a new database for the application (e.g., `dairymitra_db`).
    *   Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file with your PostgreSQL connection details:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dairymitra_db
        spring.datasource.username=your_postgres_user
        spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or validate/create depending on your needs
        spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        # Add other properties as needed
        ```
3.  **Ensure Java 17+ is Installed.** Verify with `java -version`.
4.  **Open in IDE and Build:**
    *   **IntelliJ IDEA:** Open the `backend` folder.
    *   **VSCode:** Open the `backend` folder (requires "Extension Pack for Java").
    *   **Eclipse:** Import as an existing Maven/Gradle project.
    Allow the IDE to download dependencies. You might need to trigger a build manually (e.g., `mvn clean install` or `./gradlew build`).
5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Use your IDE's run feature on the main Spring Boot application class.
    *   Or run the packaged JAR: `java -jar target/your-app.jar` (Maven) or `java -jar build/libs/your-app.jar` (Gradle).
    The backend server will start (e.g., on port `8080`).

6.  **(Optional) Expose Local API with ngrok:**
    *   Start ngrok: `ngrok http 8080` (if your backend runs on port 8080).
    *   Note the public HTTPS URL provided by ngrok.

#### 2. Frontend (Flutter)

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the repository root:
    cd dairymitra/frontend
    ```
2.  **Ensure Flutter SDK is Installed:** Verify with `flutter doctor`. Address any issues.
3.  **Create Environment Configuration File:**
    *   In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env` file (e.g., `frontend/.env`).
    *   Add your API endpoint:
        ```env
        APP_NAME="Dairy Mitra"
        API_KEY="http://localhost:8080" # For local backend
        # OR if using ngrok:
        # API_KEY="https://YOUR_NGROK_ID.ngrok-free.app"
        ```
    *   **Important:** Add `frontend/.env` to your `frontend/.gitignore` file.
        ```gitignore
        # In frontend/.gitignore
        .env
        ```
    *   Ensure your Flutter code uses a package like `flutter_dotenv` to load these variables.
4.  **Get Flutter Packages:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
5.  **Open in IDE/Editor and Run:**
    *   **Android Studio / VSCode:** Open the `frontend` folder.
    *   Select a device/emulator and run the application (`flutter run`).

### Testing Steps:

1.  **Role Selection:** Open the app and select a role.
2.  **Login:** Enter the credentials.
3.  **Dashboard Navigation:** Verify role-specific dashboards and test each feature.
4.  **Data Integrity:** Check if actions in one role reflect correctly for others (e.g., staff adding milk collection should be visible to the farmer).
5.  **Logout:** Test logout functionality.
